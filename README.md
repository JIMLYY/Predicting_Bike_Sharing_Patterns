# Predicting_Bike_Sharing_Patterns

## Introduction 
This project is a part of Deep Learning Nanodegree in Udacity. In this project, I built a neural network
to predict the bike_sharing pattern on a real dataset. This project strengthens our understanding of 
the basic concepts including gradient descent and backpropagation through building a neural network from scratch.

## Test :octocat:
1. Clone this repo to your local computer by running:
* ```git clone https://github.com/JIMLYY/Predicting_Bike_Sharing_Patterns.git```
2. If you have anaconda installed, 
* You can creat a new environment for this project by entering 
```conda create --name deep-learning python=3``` in the command line. 
* Enter your new environment by running:
   - Mac/linux >>```conda activate  deep-learning```  
   - Windows  >>```activate  deep-learning```
* Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas and jupyter notebook installed by running:
   - ```conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook```
* Run the following command to open up the notebook server:
   - ```jupyter notebook```
* Run the cell of jupyter notebook by pressing shift + return/enter

Note: If you do not have anaconda, follow the [instructions in original repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/blob/master/README.md) to set up the environemnt. 


## Try yourself:rocket:
1. If you are new to the neural network, this is a good project to check your unstanding of the basics. The original repo can 
be found at ```https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git```.
2. Use ```git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git```
to clone to repo to your local computer.
3. Try to finish the project yourself.
